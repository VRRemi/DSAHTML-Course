Welcome to the Web


Now that you are up and running on Repl.it, let's take our first step into HTML code!

HyperText Markup Language is based on what is called "tags". All tags look more or less the same. They have a specific name that is surrounded by a pair of angle brackets <>.

Something to remember is that most of the time, tags come in opening / closing pairs. Opening tags contain just the tag name, closing tags have a forward slash / that goes just before the tag name.

Example:

<body></body>
What you put in between the > of the opening tag and the < of the closing tag is the CONTENT that is shown.



Steps

1. Find the opening / closing body tag in the index.html file.
2. Write the words "Hello World" between the opening and closing body tags.
3. Click the green "Run" button at the top of the screen to see your words appear on the webpage preview window.
