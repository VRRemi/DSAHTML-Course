CSS Rules
 
 The easiest rule to follow.



 Syntax

 Syntax is a fancy word that means "the rules of a language". All languages have certain to follow when it comes to writing them down. Computer based languages are no different!

The syntax for a CSS Rule is simple as there are only two major parts to worry about:

- Selectors
- Declarations



Selectors 

Selectors are the part of a Rule where you specifiy what ELEMENTS you are styling. Look at the following example:

h1{

}

The selector in this example is h1, which means whatever you write IN BETWEEN the two curly braces will apply to ALL of the h1 tags in your html document!



Declarations

Declarations are what specify PROPERTIES and VALUES for your selector. Take a look:

h1{
  color: red;
}

The property in this example is color, which refers to the color of the text. The value here is red. Notice the special punctuation here too. A colon : seperates the property from the value and a semicolon ; marks the end of that particular declaration.

There are many different properties that you can tweak this way. Here is a reference guide just to give you an idea!
