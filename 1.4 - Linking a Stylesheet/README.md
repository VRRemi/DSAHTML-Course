Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

Make it look good!



Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS for short) are you used to some flare and formatting to your plain black and white html text document! Positioning, color, fonts, animations, effects...all can be accomplished with CSS!

To use a style sheet requires two steps:

- Create a file called style.css within the same file structure as index.html.
- Use a link tag in the index.html header section to point to your stylesheet.

AND THATS IT!



How to use the <link /> tag

There are 3 attributes we need to fill out for the link tag:

- href - This is the URL / Filepath to the stylesheet. Because we have placed it in the same root folder, we only need to reference the file name.
- rel - This specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.
- type - This is a safety net in case a particular browser does not recognize the rel attribute.

Example: <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

If your link is successful, you will notice that your headers are different colors. This is a result of the CSS rules written in styles.css, which we will talk more about tomorrow!
