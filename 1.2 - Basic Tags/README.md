Basic Tags

Lets practice using the most basic tags.



Headers

Header tags are for large, bold text. These are usually showing the seperation between sections on document, similar to headlines on a newspaper.
Header tags start with the h1 tag (largest) and go to the h6 tag (smallest).

Example: <h1> Text Goes Here </h1>



Paragraphs

Paragraph tags are for regular text. This is where the bulk of word content goes.
Whenever you have mulitple sentences of context, use a paragraph tag. The tag itself
is really simple:

Example: <p> Text Goes Here </p>
